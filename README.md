## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Running in Local Environment

### XAMPP

Install all dependencies

```bash
    composer install
```

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

```bash
    cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a new application key

```bash
    php artisan key:generate
```


Create Database on DBMS (Navicat, mysql workbench, or phpmyadmin) called as **ppi_edufest_2022**


Migrate the database schema

```bash
    php artisan migrate
```

Fresh the database schema just in case you want to drop and rebuild the schema

```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh
```

Seed the database

```bash
    php artisan db:seed
```

Start the local development server

```bash
    php artisan serve
```

You can now access the server at <http://localhost:8000>

### Docker

For docker, make sure to set`DB_HOST` in `.env` file to database container name. In this case, it should be set to `database`

Run `docker compose`

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

-d for daemonize (running in background)

For `php artisan` command, use `docker compose exec [application-container-name] php artisan [command]`

Generate a new application key

```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```


Create Database on DBMS (Navicat, mysql workbench, or phpmyadmin) called as **ppi_edufest_2022**


Migrate the database schema

```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Fresh the database schema just in case you want to drop and rebuild the schema

```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh
```

Seed the database

```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```

Database should persist regardless the container state (running, stopped, removed)
